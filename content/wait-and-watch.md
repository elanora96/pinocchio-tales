The ad in the paper had said _“145 dollars paid cash. Need someone to watch concrete. 5 hour minimum.”_

Charlie chuckled a sad laugh. The math didn’t look great, but he was barely scraping by from odd job to odd job as it was. Besides, watching concrete? This had to be a joke, and even if it wasn’t, he’d done worse for less.
